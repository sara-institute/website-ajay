**Hi there! Welcome to my profile!**

I am a data science educator and a first-generation college graduate. My wife, Dr. Kiran, and I co-founded the **SARA Institute of Data Science, India**, with the mission of making data science education accessible to the general public in India. 

When I’m not working, you’ll find me jogging or experimenting in the kitchen. 

I’d love to connect and chat with you! `hello world`
