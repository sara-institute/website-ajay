*Hello World!* ðŸ‘‹ 

I am Ajay, a data science educator on a mission to turn complex data into **actionable skills** for everyone -- no coding background required.

Through [SARA Institute of Data Science](https://sara-edu.netlify.app/) (co-founded with my wife, Dr. Kiran Lata), we are training learners across India to use data for social good, research, and innovation.

As a first-generation college graduate, I have spent several years teaching R to students and professionals -- proving data science is not just for tech elites.

**Off-duty:** Jogging, testing new recipes, or chasing my toddler around the house.

Letâ€™s chat about data, education, or why every PhD student needs R!
